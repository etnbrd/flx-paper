\section{Fluxionnal execution model} \label{section:model}

\subsection{Fluxions}

The fluxionnal execution model role is to manage and invoke autonomous execution units.
An execution unit accepts only streams as input and output, that is a continuous and infinite sequence of data contained in messages.
We named this execution unit a fluxion.
That is a function, as in functional programming, only dependent from data streams.
It is composed of a unique name, a processing function, and a persisted memory context.

Messages are composed of the name of the recipient fluxion, a body, and are carried by a messaging system.
While processing a message, the fluxion modifies its context, and sends back messages on its output streams.
The fluxion's execution context is defined as the set of state variables whose the fluxion depends on, between two rounds of execution.

The fluxions make up a chain of processing binded by data streams.
All these chains make up a directed graph, managed by the messaging system.

\subsection{Messaging system}

The messaging system is the core of our fluxionnal execution model.
It carries messages along stream, and invokes fluxion at a message reception.

It is built around a message queue.
Each message is processed one after another by invocation of the recipient fluxion.
Using a message queue allows to execute multiple processing chain fairly and concurrently, without difference in scheduling local messages, or network messages.
The life cycle of a fluxionnal application is pictured on figure \ref{fig:MesSys}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{schema-message.pdf}
  \caption{Messaging system details}
  \label{fig:MesSys}
\end{figure}

The messaging system needs every fluxion to be registered.
This registration matchs a processing function with a unique name and an initial execution context.
The messaging system carries messages streams based on the names of the recipients fluxions.
That's why two fluxions with the same name would lead the system in a conflicting situation.
The registration is done using the function \texttt{register(<nom>, <fn>, <context>)}, step \circled{1} on figure \ref{fig:MesSys}.
% A fluxion can dynamically register other fluxions

To trigger a fluxions chain, a message is sent using \texttt{start(<msg>)}, step \circled{2}.
This function pushes a first message in the queue.
Immediately, the system dequeues this message to invoke the recipient processing function, step \circled{3} and \circled{4}.
The recipient function sends back messages using \texttt{post(<msg>)}, step \circled{5}, to be enqueud in the system, \circled{6}.
The system loops through steps \circled{3} and \circled{4} until the queue is empty.

The algorithms \ref{alg:traitement} and \ref{alg:parcours} precisely describe the behavior of the messaging system after the function \texttt{start} invocation.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Message processing algorithm}
\label{alg:traitement}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Function{processMsg}{$msg$}
\For{$dest$ \textbf{in} $msg.dest$}
\State $fluxion \gets lookup(dest)$
\State $message \gets$ \Call{exec}{$fluxion, msg.body$} \Comment{\circled{4} \& \circled{5}}
\State \Call{enqueue}{$message$} \Comment{\circled{6}}
\EndFor
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Message queue walking algorithm}
\label{alg:parcours}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Function{loopMessage}{\null}
\While{$msg$ \textbf{presents in} $msgQueue$}
\State $msg \gets$ \Call{dequeue}{\null} \Comment{\circled{3}}
\State \Call{ProcessMsg}{$msg$}
\EndWhile
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{External interfaces}

In order to interact with other systems, we define external border interfaces.
As a first approach, our goal is to interface Web architectures, so we need to communicate with a REST\cite{Fielding2002} client.
We define two components in this interface :

\begin{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{In}]
    receives client connections.
    % This is so the first link in the chain.
    For every incoming connection, it relays a connection identifier to the \textbf{Out} component for the reply.
    It then relays the connection identifier and the request to the first fluxion by calling the \texttt{start} function.
	\item[\textbf{Out}]
    replies the result of the processing chain to the client.
    To receive messages from the processing chain, the component \textbf{Out} is registered in the messaging system under the name \texttt{out}.
    % This is so the last link in the chain.
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:schemaweb} pictures the specific elements of the web interface inside the fluxionnal system.
% La figure \ref{fig:schemaweb} illustre les éléments spécifiques de cette interface Web au sein du système fluxionnal illustré par la figure \ref{fig:MesSys}.

\subsection{Service example}

In order to picture the fluxionnal execution model, we present an example of a simple visit counting service.
This service counts the number of HTTP connections for each user, and sends him back this number in the HTTP reply.

The initial version of this service could look like listing \ref{lst:classique}.

\begin{code}[Javascript, caption={Initial service},label={lst:classique}]
var app = require('express')();

@\label{lst:classique_count}@var count = {};

@\label{lst:classique_get}\label{lst:classique_replyb}@app.get('/:id', function reply(req, res){
  count[req.params.id] = count[req.params.id]  || 1; @\label{lst:classique_dynres}@
  ++count[req.params.id] 
  var visits = count[req.params.id];
  var reply = req.params.id + ' connected ' + visits + ' times.';
@\label{lst:classique_send}@  res.send(reply);
@\label{lst:classique_replye}@});

port = 8080;
app.listen(port);
console.log("Listening port: "+port);
\end{code}

In listing \ref{lst:classique}, three elements are worth noticing.

\begin{itemize}
  \item The \texttt{count} object at line \ref{lst:classique_count} is a persistent memory that stores each user visit count.
  This object is mapped to a fluxion \textit{execution context} in the fluxionnal system.
  \item The \texttt{reply} function, line \ref{lst:classique_replyb} to \ref{lst:classique_replye}, contains the logic we want to express in the fluxionnal processing chain.
  \item The two methods \texttt{get} and \texttt{send}, respectively line \ref{lst:classique_get} and \ref{lst:classique_send}, interface the logic with the external interface.
  The hidden processing chain is : $\texttt{get} \to \texttt{reply} \to \texttt{send}$
\end{itemize}

This minimal service is transformed with our automatic tool into the Figure \ref{fig:fluxions} fluxions chain.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{flux.pdf}
  \caption{Count service fluxions chain}
  \label{fig:fluxions}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:fluxions}, circles represent registered fluxions.
Envelope symbols represent exchanged messages between fluxions with the data transmitted from one fluxion to the other. Finally squares stored in the messaging system hold the \textit{execution context} for the logic and \textbf{Out} fluxions.
When a new \texttt{get} REST message is received at the \textbf{In} end point, a \texttt{start} message triggers the flow.
Concurrently the \textbf{In} fluxion set a \texttt{cid} parameter to the \textbf{Out} fluxion execution context.
This \texttt{cid} is associated to the client connexion the last fluxion redirects the answer to.
The \texttt{cid} tags the request and is transmitted all the way long through the flow.
Each fluxion propagates the necessary values from one fluxion to the other exclusively within messages.
Horizontal dashed lines show message virtual transmission between fluxion although they all go through the messaging system.

Listing \ref{lst:fluxionnal} describes this counting service in our fluxionnal language.
This new language brings a stricter segmentation than the initial code by allowing the developer only to define and register fluxions.
And so, it allows an additional system to optimize how the system is organized on different physical machines according to the cost of fluxions' streams and processing.
A fluxion is defined by a name, and a list of destination preceded by the operator \texttt{>}\texttt{>}.
Fluxions can access and manipulate only two objects : \texttt{msg} and \texttt{this}.
The first is the received message, the second is the persisted object linked to the fluxion.
Fluxions use the Javascript language syntax inside their definition.

% This high level language is not dynamic, and not typed.
% You can register fluxion at any time, and the messages can contain any type or composition of types.
% \TODO{write a paragraph about the languages characteristics, a reserved subsection might be necessary, but maybe better placed in the next section, about transformation}

\begin{code}[Javascript, caption={Fluxionnal sample},label={lst:fluxionnal}]
use web

fluxion logic >> view
  this.uid[msg.uid] = this.uid[msg.uid] + 1 || 1
  msg.count = this.uid[msg.uid]
  post msg

fluxion view >> output
  msg.view = msg.uid + " connected " + msg.count + " times."
  msg.uid = undefined
  msg.count = undefined
  post msg

register logic, {uid: {}}
register view

web.listen
\end{code}

Except from the two interface components, the service is split as follow :
\begin{itemize}
  \item The \texttt{logic} fluxion is the first to receive the client message.
  It contains the whole logic of this simple service.
  A real service would need a more complex chain with logic distributed across multiple fluxions, instead of a single fluxion.
  It increments the count for the received user identifier, push this count inside the message, and relay it the next fluxion.
  \item The \texttt{view} fluxion receives this message, formats it as the user will view it, and relay it to the output fluxion.
\end{itemize}

We use this interface to develop web services using the fluxionnal execution model.
But our goal, as described in the introduction, is to automate this architecture shift, not to impose a new programming paradigm onto the developer.
% We now evaluate this model against the basic one.
