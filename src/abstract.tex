The audience's growth of a web application is highly uncertain, it can increase and decrease in a matter of hours if not minutes.
This uncertainty often leads the development team to quickly adopt disruptive and continuity-threatening shifts of technology to deal with the higher connections spikes.
To avoid these shifts, we propose to abstract web applications into a high-level language, allowing a high-level code reasoning.
This reasoning may allow later to provide code mobility to dynamically cope with audience growth and decrease.

We propose a compiler to transform a Javascript, monolithic, web application into a network of small independent parts communicating by message streams.
We named these parts \textit{fluxions}, by contraction between a flux and a function.
We expect dynamic reorganization of these parts in a cluster of machine can help an application to deal with its load in the same way network routers do with IP traffic.
