\section{Conclusion} \label{section:conclusion}

In this paper, we presented our work to enable a \textit{Node.js} application to be dynamically and automatically scalable.
The emerging design for an application to be scalable is to split it into parts to reduce coupling.
From this insight, we designed an execution model for applications structured as a network of independent parts communicating by streams of messages.
In a second part, we presented a compiler to transform a Javascript application into a network of independent parts.
To identify these parts, we spotted rupture points as indicators for a possible parallelism and memory distribution.
This compilation tool allow for the use of the distributed architecture previously described to enable scalability, with a minimum change on the imperative programming style mastered by most developers.
