\section{Conclusion} \label{section:conclusion}

In this paper, we presented our work to enable a Javascript application to be dynamically and automatically scalable.
The emerging design for an application to be scalable is to split it into parts to reduce coupling.
From this insight, we designed an execution model for applications structured as a network of independent parts communicating by stream of messages.
In a second part, we presented a compiler to transform a Javascript application into a network of independent parts.
To identify these parts, we spot the asynchronous function calls and their callbacks, as indicators for a possible parallelism.
This compilation tool allow to make use of the distributed architecture previously described to enable scalability, with a minimum change on the imperative programming style mastered by most developers.
